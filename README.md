# Pests Image Classification 🐛🪲

I whipped up this cool project to classify pest images, and guess what? I used transfer learning with `MobileNetV2`, and it nailed an accuracy score of `0.9467`! Basically, the model can tell if it's dealing with `aphids`, `armyworms`, `beetles`, `bollworms`, `grasshoppers`, `mites`, `mosquitoes`, `sawflies`, or `stem borers`. It's like having a pest detective on standby, helping farmers spot trouble and protect their crops like a boss. Use the saved model named **mobilenetv2.keras** to directly use it without training a new model on the dataset.
